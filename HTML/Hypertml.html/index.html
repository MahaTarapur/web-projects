    <p align="center">Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive <br>Definitions of music vary depending on culture,[4] though it is an aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal.[5] While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions. The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance,though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.</p>
    <h1>Etymology and terminology</h1>
    <p align="right">The modern English word 'music' came into use in the 1630s.It is derived from a long line of successive precursors: the Old English 'musike' of the mid-13th century; the Old French musique of the 12th century; and the Latin mūsica.<br>The Latin word itself derives from the Ancient Greek mousiké (technē)—μουσική (τέχνη)—literally meaning "(art) of the Muses".The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences.<br>They were included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod,and eventually came to be associated with music specifically.Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses.<br>The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish música and French musique via spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian musica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muzïka.</p>
    <h1>Therapy</h1>
    <p align="Justify">Music therapy is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. <br>In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music;in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging.<br> It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, support physical exercise, and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.</p>
